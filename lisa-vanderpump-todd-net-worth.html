She came to the show with a small fan base already, made up of people who remembered her appearances on shows such as "Baywatch Nights", throughout the 80s and 90s. From releasing a book on how to entertain, to starring in her own spin-off reality series, "VanderPump Rules", Ms. VanderPump-Todd has done her best to turn her reality show stint, into a Kardashian-style money-making juggernaut.

Before they moved to the United States, the Vanderpumps designed 26 London-based bars and restaurants. This is where the stars go to see and be seen. Lisa did all the designing of the couple's 26 restaurants, bars, and clubs herself, and has really enjoyed this major endeavor. Her life's motto is "find something you love doing, and you will never have to WORK a day in your life." When they moved to California, they opened four restaurants. Villa Blanca is based in Beverly Hills and Sur, Pump, and TomTom are based in West Hollywood. In July 2023, the Pump Restaurant location closed. Lisa wrote a book in 2011, Simply Divine: A Guide to Easy, Elegant, and Affordable Entertaining.</p><p>Vanderpump is also a writer for Beverly Hills Lifestyle Magazine (she became Editor in Chief in March 2017) and she helped develop a serious skin care line with her partner, Dr. Simon Ourian at Epione. She designs most of her own clothing, with a little help from her dear friends Christina Makowsky and Alan Del Rosario.

Ryan and Andrew claimed that the couple illegally snatched the West Hollywood venue where they had planned to open a bar.</p><h2 id=philanthropy><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>Lisa describes herself and her husband, Ken, as philanthropic, since the couple supports many various charities. Most notably, they support Keep Memory Alive, founded by Larry Ruvo. Keep Memory Alive was established to bring awareness to different neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. In 2015, Lisa was awarded with the Ally Leadership Award from Equality California, which is an LGBTQ rights organization. Later that same year, Vanderpump organized a protest against the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival in China. The Vanderpump Dog Foundation hosted its first World Dog Day event that fall. Lisa is also a longtime supporter of The Trevor Project and she recorded a PSA to emphasize and reassure LGBTQ people that they are loved, have enormous value in the world, and are never alone. In 2019, Vanderpump teamed up with Richard Ayoub to work with Project Angel Food, who gives out meals to people struggling.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Lisa and Ken Todd became engaged just six weeks after meeting, in 1982, and were already hitched within three months.

Lisa also has a stepson from her husband's first marriage and one grandson from her daughter.</p><p>In March 2013, Vanderpump received the Key to the City of Beverly Hills, and March 1st was declared "Lisa Vanderpump Day" in recognition of her charitable and philanthropic work.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real</strong> <strong>Estate</strong></h2><p>Ken Todd and Lisa Vanderpump own a mansion in the Beverly Crest neighborhood of Beverly Hills called Villa Rosa.
