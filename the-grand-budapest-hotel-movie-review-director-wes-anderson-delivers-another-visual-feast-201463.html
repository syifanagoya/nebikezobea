Director Wes Anderson's films are so artistically exquisite that they should be framed and mounted. And this effort — primarily set in a quaint European town in the fictional Republic of Zubrowskain the 1930s — may be his most astounding. For not only has the auteur delivered another intricately constructed visual feast, he adds a rich tale (one half murder-mystery, one half crime caper), and a healthy dose of madcap humor."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>The Grand Budapest Hotel Review: Wes Anderson Delivers &amp;quot;Visual Feast&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>In theaters Friday, March 7</strong></p><p><strong>3 stars (out of 4 stars)</strong></p><p>Director <strong>Wes Anderson</strong>'s films are so artistically exquisite that they should be framed and mounted. And this effort — primarily set in a quaint European town in the fictional Republic of Zubrowskain the 1930s — may be his most astounding. For not only has the auteur delivered another intricately constructed visual feast, he adds a rich tale (one half murder-mystery, one half crime caper), and a healthy dose of madcap humor.</p><p>They don't make 'em like the Grand Budapest Hotel anymore. It's the kind of place that looks like a frosted castle burrowed under sparkles in a snow globe. It's also where genteel concierge Monsieur Gustave (<strong>Ralph Fiennes</strong>) pampers his elderly female customers and takes pains to get to know them. This may or may not always be in the biblical sense.&nbsp;</p><p>The long-winded backstory doesn't perk up until Gustave's favorite client dies (<strong>Tilda Swinton</strong> in remarkable old-age makeup) and leaves him with a one-of-a-kind painting called Boy With Apple. Her son Dmitri (<a href=#><strong>Adrien Brody</strong></a>) forbids him from taking it; he swipes it anyway. Then promptly ends up in prison. (Only in Anderson's world could a drab jail be bolded by the sight of vividly colored square patisserie boxes delivered to Gustave.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gustave escapes and tries to clear his name by way motorcycles, a bobsled run (!), a cable car that runs in the mountains and a confession in a monastery booth. Not only is this a delightful sequence, it's an excuse for Anderson to employ his go-to ensemble, including <strong>Bill Murray</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Owen Wilson</strong></a>. (<strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong> also has a droll cameo). Still, Fiennes is the one who leads the way with his effortless wit and comedic charm. In his final noble act, he makes a heartwarming and selfless gesture toward his bright-eyed young protégé, Zero. Yes, the sadistic Nazi from Schindler's List and Lord Voldemort himself! Who knew?</p><p>And like all Anderson films, the love is in the eccentric details — from the decorative cake slices to all those handcrafted, bright uniforms. Priceless stuff.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2cv6K6w2aZrpyRpbK0wIyhpq2dnGK6sMLInmSrnaaesrh5w6KpnpukpL9uw8SsZJqmlJq%2FtLvNZpuepJmrsrO%2FjJqlqKyYmr9uwsisrJqkXZuyor%2FTZmlpaWRrgHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-alan-siegel-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>David Alan Siegel Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
