I know it's past visitin hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The docter don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anestisia
It'll send her body into a seizure
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time?
Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon be fine"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
