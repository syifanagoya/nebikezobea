Is Diane Keaton Related to Michael Keaton?</h2><p>It turns out&nbsp;Diane and&nbsp;Michael are not related to each other.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The only linking point between them is their similar last name — and it has been creating confusion amongst the fans. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Besides, while many are confused about this fact, some seem to have known it already.</p><p>For instance,&nbsp;a November 2017 tweet read, “Just here to say that I’m kinda disappointed that Diane Keaton and Michael Keaton are not related.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I thought Diane Keaton and Michael Keaton were related. It turns out, Keaton isn't even her last name. — alvin.mp4 (@chipmnk) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 21, 2011</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Going further back, someone tweeted in December 2011, clarifying, “fact check: Diane Keaton and Michael Keaton are not related. Her real name is Diane Hall and his is Michael Douglas!!! for rel no joke.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Michael Keaton’s Name Is Reportedly Inspired by Diane Keaton</h2><p>Michael’s real name is not Michael Keaton but&nbsp;Michael John Douglas.</p><p>Speaking on&nbsp;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in June 2017, the&nbsp;Batman star revealed that he had to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">choose a stage name</a> for himself at the beginning of his career.</p><p>He explained that there was already an established celebrity with the last name&nbsp;Douglas [Pike Douglas]. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Because of that, the industry people asked him to change his name, even though he said he was very proud of his actual name.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As per him, some people also argued that&nbsp;his real name would not make a good impression on the audience.</p><p>“I got a gig, I was just starting out and I got this job, and because of the union, there was Pike Douglas who used to have a talk show. And somebody said well, you know, you have to change your name,” he stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But why did he choose&nbsp;Keaton for his last name?</p><p>According to some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit users</a> and Twitterati,&nbsp;when&nbsp;Michael had to pick a new name for himself, he chose&nbsp;Keaton because he was fascinated by Diane.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fans’ theories related to Michael Keaton’s stage name. </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Reddit) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Meanwhile, some also claim that the rumor of Keaton changing his surname because of an attraction to Diane was incorrect.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Instead, he chose Keaton because of an affinity for the physical comedy of Buster Keaton.</p><p>However, the specific reason behind why he chose&nbsp;Keaton is still unclear.</p><h2>Diane Keaton Also Has a Real Name</h2><p>Not only&nbsp;Michael but&nbsp;Diane also has a real name. While&nbsp;Diane Keaton is her stage name, her birth name is&nbsp;Diane Hall.</p><p>The reason she changed her last name is also similar to&nbsp;Michael.</p><p>When she started her career, there was already another&nbsp;Diane Hall who belonged to the Actor’s Equity Association. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hence, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">replaced her last name</a> with her mother’s last name.
