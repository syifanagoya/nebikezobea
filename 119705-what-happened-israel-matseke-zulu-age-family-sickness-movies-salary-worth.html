He attended the Gordon Combined School, but sadly from 1988, he took to a life of crime. Israel Matseke Zulu's house robberies landed him behind bars in 1996.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Matseke Zulu was sentenced to eight years in jail, where he formed the <i>Abaqobi Drama Group</i> among the inmates. When he was released in 1999, he found employment with the<i> Victory Sonqoba Theatre Company</i>, where he got the chance to try out for the award-winning <i>SABC1 </i>drama series <i>Yizo Yizo.</i></p><p class=align-left>In 2015, he starred as Jakes Masilo, Killer's right-hand man, in the<i> eTV </i>drama series <i>Z'bondiwe</i>. His <i><a href=#>Mzansi</a> Magic</i> soapie <i>isiBaya</i> debut occurred in November 2016 in the form of the mobster Cyprian Gumbi. He has since appeared in several television shows and <a href=#>movies</a>, most recently playing the role of Don in <i><a href=#>Gomora. </a></i>The most popular <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Israel Matseke Zulu </a>movies include his portrayal of a Bracelet soldier on <i>The Good Lie</i> and Skroef on <i>Avenged</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a4477561ae477620.png><h3>Family</h3><p class=align-left>Is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Israel Matseke Zulu </a>married? Although he has fathered two sons, the South African actor has never been wed. He was allegedly dating Wabantu, a singer and socialite, but Zulu flatly refuted the allegation.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, it was reported that one of the star's sons, Tebogo, was shot and killed in 2011.</p><h3>What is happening with Israel Matseke Zulu?</h3><p class=align-left>You may be missing your favourite <i><a href=#>Gomora</a> </i>actor, but did you know he asked to be written off the show due to Israel Matseke Zulu's sickness? After several months of pain in his leg, he was finally convinced by his friend, Mzwakhe Sigudla, to seek medical attention. Unfortunately, doctors discovered that he was suffering from gangrene which, without treatment, would start affecting his kidneys and other limbs.</p><p class=align-left>So, what happened to actor Israel? According to<i> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sunday World</a></i>, he consented to have his<a href=#> leg amputated</a> since the agony was intensifying but rescheduled the appointments multiple times. After a four-week hospitalisation at the <i>Rob Ferreira Hospital</i> in Nelspruit, <a href=#>Mpumalanga</a>, he eventually underwent the procedure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/6c50d12e4dbfa1b7.png><p class=align-left>After a long and painful battle, Israel Matseke Zulu's illness seems to be under control, although he, unfortunately, lost a foot in the process. However, this loss will undoubtedly not put a damper on his enthusiasm for acting, and, although it seems he will no longer be appearing in <i>Gomora</i>, we anticipate his return to the screens in another iconic notorious gangster role.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Thembi Seete Expresses Gratitude for Her 'Gomora' Gang After Their Support at 'True Love' Cover Launch</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>We</a> and <a href=#>Thembi Seete</a> proudly announce that she is the current cover girl for True Love magazine.</p><p class=align-left>The actress went on a thanksgiving binge, thanking everyone from the editor-in-chief of the journal to her management team and her family in her posts. <a href=#>Thembi ended her messages </a>by applauding her Gomora female squad for their positive attitude.
