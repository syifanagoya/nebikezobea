Bordelon selected the initial lineup with teenage social-media savant Cameron “Cam” Dallas, whom he calls “hands down the No. 1 star in social media.” They ended up with an amorphous group of about ten online whiz kids with varying “</span><span><a href=#>talents</a>,</span><span>” including Nash Grier, Carpenter, Dallas, Mendes, and one female, Mahogany Lox, a kind of ringleader/</span><a href=#><span>feline mascot</span></a><span>/DJ. At its peak, Magcon sold roughly 2,000 tickets to each of its events, including VIP packages offering one-on-one time with your favorite Magcon boy. Mendes, a self-taught guitarist whose six-second, stripped-down </span><a href=#><span>acoustic covers of pop songs</span></a><span> by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber have earned him close to 3.5 million followers on Vine, stood out to Bordelon. Unlike Taylor Caniff, a Magconner known for </span><a href=#><span>run-ins with the law</span></a><span>, Mendes, who didn’t stay up late or engage in antics with his peers, seemed genuinely interested in building a career.</span></p><h2 class=related-stories-title data-editable=title>Related Stories</h2><a href=# class="related-story-link has-image bg-story-9FKJ1fkZ"><span class=img></span> <span class=title>Shawn Mendes Is the Vine Star With a Record Deal That You’ll Be Hearing About</span></a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00c2c6c1b05a9e8b03a41b0bdd8a8670-6-0-0@published data-word-count=201><span>Magcon broke up about a year ago, after a disagreement between Grier’s management and Bordelon. (Some fans were so upset that they </span><a href=#><span>resorted to cutting</span></a><span> and </span><span><a href=#>dirty fanfiction</a>.</span><span>) By that time, though, Magcon copycats with major backing, like YouTube’s DigitTour, had already gained traction among the viral teen set. Former Magcon boys like Grier’s brother Hayes, as well as Carpenter, are now with DigiTour, which expects to sell </span><a href=#><span>250,000 tickets this year</span></a><span>. But Bordelon tells me that there will never been another Magcon. “It’s like the ’92 Olympic basketball team, the Dream Team,” he says. “That will never be duplicated. That’s once in a lifetime. That’s it.” Mendes, whom Bordelon says never wanted to leave the homespun community built by the Magcon family, eventually signed to Island Records and released an </span><a href=#><span>eponymous EP</span></a><span> of original songs that reached No. 5 on the charts last year. He never had any of the Magcon boys under contract and believes Magcon was on its way toward “One Direction status.” He no longer has a professional relationship with Mendes, but remains close with his family. In his words, “that’s what happens when you have a novice like me that had never been in entertainment before.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00c2c6c1b05a9e8b03a41b0bdd8a8670-7-0-0@published data-word-count=117><span>So far, Mendes is the only Magconner to translate his online success story into chart-topping fame, but his old comrades continue to plug away, hoping, as many would-be digital celebs do, to turn internet stardom into real-life success. They’ll always have Magcon to thank for giving them their start, though, says Bordelon, who still looks back on his days at Magcon fondly. “It was lightning in a bottle,” he says. “The talent themselves, they don’t really understand what could have been. I think when they get to my age, when they get into their 30s, they’re going to look back on this and say, ‘Wow, we really were about to go down in history as something huge.’”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgaXy0tMCwpWallaOxpr%2BMmqWdZZFiwLa%2Bz6ugrJ1do7xufYyao5utnWO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-kroft-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Kroft Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
