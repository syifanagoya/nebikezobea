He developed the hit TV series, "Star Trek", which went on to capture American hearts and imaginations with futuristic spacecraft, weaponry and plots. Born to an epic producer, Roddenberry had a big shoe to fill since a very young age. Many worshiped his father as a legend. Though, his father was famous for his creation of one of the most successful science fiction TV series in the history of America, Roddenberry did not grow up watching the show. He had a hard time identifying with the status and appeal of "Star Trek." However, in 1991, when he was 17 years old, his father passed away. After that, he began to seriously immerse himself in the "Star Trek" series and investigated as to why the series was so marked among its adoring fans.</p><p>Roddenberry sanctioned the 2009 "Star Trek" featured film by J. J. Abrams, and was reported as saying that "Star Trek" is cool again. In 2011, Roddenberry fully inherited his father legacy and became Chief Executive Officer of Roddenberry Entertainment.
