In 1997, Bergman portrayed <a href=#>Jack Abbott</a> in an episode "The Heather Biblow story" on The Nanny, where he shared an on-screen kiss with Pamela Anderson. In 2001, he guest starred as Jack on The King of Queens in an episode of Season 3.</p><p>In a Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup advertising campaign in 1986, Bergman told the viewing audience, "I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV." <a href=#>Chris Robinson</a>, who played Dr. Rick Webber on ABC's General Hospital, was the original spokesperson in the ad campaign, which started in 1984. Bergman replaced Robinson after the latter experienced some legal difficulties. The writer of the commercial used this opening line as a disclaimer, because the then-existing "white coat rule" prohibited people from portraying doctors in commercials without some sort of clarification/disclaimer. The original commercial with <a href=#>Chris Robinson</a> became the most-recalled TV commercial in the history of the Vicks brand.</p><p>Bergman originally auditioned for the All My Children role of Dr. <a href=#>Jeff Martin</a>. His first notable role was his portrayal of Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children, which he played from 1979 to 1987 and again from 1988-89. His character, Cliff, married Nina (Taylor Miller) four times (1980, 1982, 1986, and 1989) and divorced her three times. When the characters left the serial, their fourth marriage was intact.</p><p>The son of Walter Bergman, a United States Navy officer, he was born in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He later graduated from Crossland Senior High School in Camp Springs, Maryland. Bergman was married to actress <a href=#>Christine Ebersole</a> from 1976 to 1981. In 1985, he married Mariellen, with whom he has two children.</p><p>Peter Michael Bergman (born June 11, 1953) is an American actor best known for his portrayals as Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children (1979–89) as well as <a href=#>Jack Abbott</a> on The Young and the Restless (1989–present).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfpbK1sdFmmZ6ql6Kurw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barstools-dave-portnoy-explains-decision-behind-his-miami-move-1535792.html><span>←</span><span>Barstools Dave Portnoy explains decision behind his Miami move</span></a>
