The second season of Cobra Kai premiered in April 2019. Both Ralph and <a href=#>William Zabka</a>, who reprises his role as Johnny, earned a reported $100,000 per episode for the first two seasons, which works out to around $1 million per season per person. They serve as co-executive producers on the project.</p><p>The series is executive produced by <a href=#>Will Smith</a> because his company, Overbrook Productions, licensed the rights from <a href=#>Jerry Weintraub's</a> company, Weintraub Entertainment Group. This marks Macchio's first venture into working on a web series, but previously he has had plenty of experience working in television.</p><p>The first season was released in May 2018. It received universal high praise but unfortunately low viewership because no one has YouTube Red… and no one wants YouTube Red… no matter how many times the app desperately tries to hit you over the head with pop ups and reminders. Thankfully, in August 2020 the show was finally released on Netflix where it found a wider audience and became one of the most-popular shows on the platform. The show will air at least four total season on Netflix.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Off-screen, Ralph Macchio is married to a nurse practitioner, Phyllis Fierro, with whom he has two children. They were introduced by his grandmother when he was just 15 years old. They married in 1987. He owns the 1947 yellow Ford that he waxes in Karate Kid.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Ralph and Phyllis have long-owned an ocean-view home in Montauk, NY. When they aren't using it themselves, the property can be rented for as much as $40,000 per month. It's worth at least $4 million and maybe as much as $5-6 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZL%2BiuM%2BhZKaZk5i1qruMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-trent-season-2-release-date-revealed-whats-in-store-for-will-and-his-team.html><span>←</span><span>Will Trent Season 2 Release Date Revealed: What's in Store for Will and His Team?</span></a>
