Growing up in County Meath, Ireland, I would write little monologues and perform them to nobody. I remember telling my mom that this is what I was going to do and that I was going to be successful at it. I don't know where the hell that came from — and I still don't. It took ages for me to actually build the confidence to have a go at show business, though I picked up some useful skills from being raised in Ireland that served me well along the way.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>David Alan Siegel Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</h2><time>Mar 6, 2024</time>

Director Wes Anderson's films are so artistically exquisite that they should be framed and mounted. And this effort — primarily set in a quaint European town in the fictional Republic of Zubrowskain the 1930s — may be his most astounding. For not only has the auteur delivered another intricately constructed visual feast, he adds a rich tale (one half murder-mystery, one half crime caper), and a healthy dose of madcap humor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nikki Reed News - Us Weekly</h2><time>Mar 5, 2024</time>

The film made just $80 million during its domestic run — not terrible by any means, but hardly the type of sum associated with an action franchise starter. But thanks to the international popularity of star Tom Cruise, the film brought in another $138 million overseas.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/22/>← Prev Page</a>
