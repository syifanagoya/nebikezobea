<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Jenny McCarthy Talks &amp;quot;Small&amp;quot; Wedding to Donnie Wahlberg, The View</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>On to the next one! <strong><a href=#>Jenny McCarthy</a> </strong>opened up in an interview with <strong>Howard Stern</strong> about everything from her "small" upcoming wedding to <strong>Donnie Wahlberg</strong> to how she feels The View&nbsp;was just a "stepping stone" for herself.</p><p>When asked about her upcoming nuptials to Wahlberg, who she got <a href=#>engaged to</a> in April, the blonde told Stern the wedding will feature around "80 guests" and "no celebrities" and is set to occur in "the next couple months." But don't expect Donnie's brother <strong><a href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a></strong> to be the best man at the small fete. When asked if the Transformers: Age of Extinction actor will take on the role, McCarthy surprisingly said, "No," explaining, "Let’s just say our children are very much a part of this wedding."</p><p>One celebrity who will be invited though is McCarthy's View co-host <strong><a href=#>Sherri Shepherd</a></strong>, who is also out at the ABC talk show after seven seasons. "Sherri Shepherd will be the only one [celebrity invited] possibly if she can make it," the talk show host admitted.</p><p>Stern went on to ask the 41-year-old about her stint on the talk show, which ABC announced on June 26 <a href=#>she'd be leaving after only one season</a> as a co-host. "The most rewarding [part of being on The View] has definitely been working with <strong><a href=#>Barbara Walters</a> </strong>for a year, I mean work[ing] under her and just … asking her questions backstage has been the most intriguing thing," she told the radio host.</p><p>As for if she was "fired," McCarthy answered, "Yes and no," adding, "If I wanted to stay with <strong><a href=#>Rosie [O'Donnell]</a></strong> and I was a Republican, I would still be there right now."</p><p>The former MTV host went on to admit she felt like she wasn't able to be her true self at the round table.</p><p>"I’ll tell you something Howard, it’s like halfway into it, it was probably around February, I went, 'God I’m not allowed to be the best of me here,' I feel like to have a voice, to be able to speak without having to interrupt people…It’s very difficult, and I don’t like doing it, it’s very uncomfortable, so I felt like, 'You know what? Maybe this is just a stepping stone for me to go somewhere where I can actually be my full self.'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Since Barbara left, I’ve been able to be more of myself," she added, "I get a little bit more space, but I still hate, hate, hate the interrupting part."</p><p>And she won't have to do much interrupting with her next gig. McCarthy also announced during her interview with Howard she'll be joining SiriusXM to host a weekly satellite radio show titled Dirty, Sexy, Funny with Jenny McCarthy, where she will discuss everything from parenting to sex and marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's no secret that I love to talk. I'm excited to do it on SiriusXM without having to interrupt anyone or keep things clean. You can bet your sweet ass this show will live up to its title," McCarthy said of her new gig, which is set to feature interviews with celebrities like <strong><a href=#>Chelsea Handler</a></strong> and premieres on July 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGepp6ueq6vwpqpraCpYsGiuMqsZKylkaG5bsPEnZuippdiwbB5w6ilp6GVYsSitMubnKufXam1pnnVopywZWJlfnV9k3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./easter-2023-how-kardashian-jenner-family-celebrated-in-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Easter 2023: How Kardashian-Jenner Family Celebrated in Photos</span></a>
