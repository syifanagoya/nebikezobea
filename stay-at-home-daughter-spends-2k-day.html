I don’t like having too much clutter so I will donate them.</p><p>“If I have taken a picture in an outfit and it doesn’t have that new feel, I go off it.”</p><p>Aside from her wardrobe Roma’s biggest expense are her beauty treatments of which there are many.</p><p>Taking care of yourself as a woman is a job in itself.''</p><span class=quote-credit>Roma Abdesselam</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>New York</span><p>“Every three months I get Botox and microblading,” Roma says.</p><p>“Every other month it will be microneedling and chemical peels and then once a week I have a body tightening treatment as well as a lymphatic massage and a facial.”</p><p>While Roma, who travels abroad ten times a year, is more than happy with her role as a stay-at-home-daughter, she says that her parents are keen for her to start paying her way.</p><p>And after one particularly expensive spree, Roma was forced to put a cap on her spending.</p><p>“I never used to have an allowance but eventually my parents put one in place because I was spending around £122k a month,” she says.</p><p>“I had my credit card taken away from me.</p><p>“My family do push me to get a job and they also push me to get married because they don’t want me to rely on them financially, I’m kind of like a leech.”</p><p>And to her family’s delight, Roma has been able to partially fund herself over the past year thanks to her TikTok account Therealsahd (Stay at Home Daughter).</p><p>Her videos showcasing her luxurious life garner as many as 15 million views each meaning Roma now rakes in around £20,000 a month from her social media channel.</p><p>But her newfound fortune comes at a price with Roma admitting she often gets death threats from trolls, not that it bothers her.</p><p>She says: “I love my trolls.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you start defending yourself it’s nowhere near as funny as if you start poking them.</p><p>“I talk to my haters and usually they’ll apologise because they never think I will respond.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“Sometimes they do really irk me, especially when they target my friends or family, say what you want about me but leave them out of it.</p><p>“But when they’re telling me how ugly I am I just have to laugh because their comments are so ridiculous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/eac426aa-ceec-4868-98c6-e98dba3286b0.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/d2f2fe55-4ba8-4888-9e33-d9a1c8a8500c.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/c2bb489a-c53c-4a3b-aba9-59eab0da91cf.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme5Rva25wYml8tMDAsmSarF2dvK6xjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzedKpnKeco2J%2FrHnDmrBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./psy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-html.html><span>←</span><span>Psy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
