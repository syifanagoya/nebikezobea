The federal government wasn't exactly thrilled with Lennon's anti-war sentiments, either, and tried valiantly (and failed) to have him deported, according to <a href=#>NPR News</a>. Elvis himself wanted the Beatles gone, too. And on December 21, 1970, the King met none other than President <a href=#>Richard Nixon</a>, according to <a href=#>Vox</a>. There, he tried to convince the POTUS to find a way to get rid of Lennon and the Beatles.</p><p dir=ltr>"The Beatles had been a real force for anti-American spirit. [They] came to this country, made their money, and then returned to England where they promoted an anti-American theme," Elvis said at the time.</p><p dir=ltr>Again in 1971, Elvis tried to get someone in power to get rid of the Fab Four. Touring the offices of the FBI, he told then-director J. Edgar Hoover that "the Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FmG1nbmpfmLKtscGroK2hlah6prjVoqpmm5%2BquaW602aqrZmemXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlotte-rae-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Charlotte Rae Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
