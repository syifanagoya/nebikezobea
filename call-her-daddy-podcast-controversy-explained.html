Scroll down for a detailed explanation of the drama.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">'Call Her Daddy' podcast controversy explained: the war with Barstool Sports.</h2><p>To fully understand <a href=#>the beef</a> surrounding Apple Podcasts’ No. 1 show, you need to know the basics of its origin story. Call Her Daddy debuted in October 2018 under the Barstool Sports brand and grew to become the top-rated female podcast on iTunes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Barstool Sports</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, Alexandra and Sofia agreed to a three-year contract with the media group, reportedly earning an annual base salary of $75,000 plus a bonus if they reached a certain number of listeners.</p><p>Well, the show became such a hit that the duo was allegedly inundated with other offers — offers that were far more appealing than their contract with Barstool. Reports suggest the women expressed a desire to part ways with the brand in April, setting off what has since become a s--tstorm.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Alexandra and Sofia are] not speaking to each other anymore," an insider told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> on May 16, revealing that the roommates "turned on each other" after disagreeing over how to proceed with their partnership.&nbsp;</p><p>"[They’ve] started arguing over who was the real talent and who did more of the heavy lifting [for the podcast]," the source continued. "I think their audience would be surprised to learn what has been going on behind the scenes with them. It’s not the loyal, fun-loving friendship they put out there."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Apparently, Sofia’s boyfriend, HBO Sports executive vice president Peter Nelson, is partly to blame for the breakdown. "He was quietly shopping them [to other podcast networks] even though they were still under contract with Barstool," the insider alleged.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The founder of Barstool Sports claims he tried to negotiate with the girls.</h2><p>Fans were caught off guard when a new episode of Call Her Daddy dropped on May 17 following a five-week hiatus. But instead of hearing Alexandra and Sofia's voices, listeners were treated to Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy's side of the story in a 29-minute installment titled "Daddy Speaks."</p><p>"We offered them mid- to high six-figure salaries and a way for them to get the intellectual property," the 43-year-old shared in an interview with The Post after learning of his podcasters’ restlessness. "We offered them substantial raises just to get them to honor their existing contract."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Alexandra was apparently on board with the new terms, but Sofia put up a fight, causing David to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pull the plug</a> on the whole deal. "[Sofia] lost the Call Her Daddy battle by being an idiot and listening to bad f--king advice from bad f--king people," he said, seemingly referring to Peter, the brunette beauty’s boyfriend.</p><p>"I feel bad for Sofia in a way, because I have such a big f--king heart. But you did this all by yourself," David declared. "You can’t cry about getting stabbed in the back when you were stabbing us in the back."</p><p>But in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a> on May 20, the blogger announced that Barstool isn’t looking to replace the women because "if we can work something out with them, great" — yet he couldn’t resist another jab at both Sofia and Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>When talking about how Barstool is always looking for new talent, David said, "Down the road, you could be the next huge star — and then you can date a guy in a f--king weird-looking suit who thinks he’s smarter than everybody else and try to f--k everybody over."</p><p>Yeah… this drama is still raging.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6tuIyhnKtllJaxpcWMqaadm5GowW6vzqerq6emmr%2B0xYyer6mkkZ67prA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colin-kaepernicks-protesting-national-anthem-boosted-jersey-sales.html><span>←</span><span>Colin Kaepernick Now Has The #1 Highest-Selling NFL Jersey - Plans To Donate Proceeds</span></a>
