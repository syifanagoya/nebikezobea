That’s because it’s only for those people who actually have “them good knees,” that is.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>In all honesty, it’s one of the more positive challenges out there. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Some trending challenges</a> have had people denying themselves of oxygen, setting themselves on fire, or driving while impairing their vision. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the “good knees” challenge</a> doesn’t do any of that. It is like going to the gym, and the next day, those muscles are going to feel the pain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What is it?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Leonard Thornton (@cntry662)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>The lyrics to the song go as follows, “Two hands up, keep them up/Two hands up, keep them up/Two hands up, keep them up/Take it to the floor/Take it to the floor/Take it to the floor/Take it to the floor/Take it to the floor/Take it to the floor/Good knees, good knees, good knees, good knees, good knees, good knees…”</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>That’s just the beginning. While the dancer is in the squat position after taking it to the floor, Cntry keeps repeating, “Keep them hands up, keep them up, you’re shaking.” This is where the muscles start burning, and some people fall out. Others are pros and last through the countdown.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>That’s why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this one is a good challenge</a>, but it can only be done one time a night. Any more than that, and everyone can take leg day off the next day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-did-it-come-from data-injectable=false>Where did it come from?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cntry.png><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>When “cntrydude662” posted a teaser of his new song on TikTok, he sang some lyrics that were accompanied by a dance move. That dance move is what’s trending, and “Cntry” is still running the show. Even though he removed his original video on TikTok, by then it had already made its rounds. There were many TikTokers who were trying to last through the grueling challenge and some of them did quite well.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=false>While Cntry’s identity eludes searchers on TikTok, that doesn’t mean he can’t be found anywhere else on the internet. A little investigation has him popping up on Instagram as Leonard Thornton. It’s easy to see it’s him because his profile literally says, “GOODKNEESCHALLENGECREATOR.” He also says he’s a host, promoter, and artist. His Instagram videos support that he’s quite the performer and promoter while showing off this new challenge in style.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tLTOrqOdZamkwm7A0bJkraCVYrSwu8Nmoqedlah6tbXKraakZZOdrq24xKeenmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steele-stebbins.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is Steele Stebbins?
