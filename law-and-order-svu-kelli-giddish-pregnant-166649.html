She even stood alongside her co-star <a href=# rel=dofollow>Mariska Hargitay</a>, whom she admitted has given her tips on how to balance her busy career and motherhood.</p><p>“Mariska’s given me advice and I sit and take it because, you know, she’s got a great family and she [creates] a great family for us at SVU,” Kelli shared with <a href=# rel=dofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a> of the mom-of-three. “If it weren’t for her setting that tone, it would be a much much different place to work.”</p><p>During Kelli’s first pregnancy, she actually incorporated the fact that she was expecting into her Law and Order: SVU storyline. “I looked up when I first got pregnant what other TV shows did and… I guess on The X-Files, she went away. She got abducted by aliens,” Kelli joked at the time. “So I was like, ‘That can’t happen on SVU. Can’t pitch that idea.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kelli-giddish-law-and-order-pregnant.jpg><p>Her character announced she was pregnant at the start of Season 17 and she was immediately determined to find out who the father was. Spoiler alert: it ended up being Lt. Declan Murphy (played by Donal Logue). Here’s hoping her next storyline has something to do with baby No. 2!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lmLBlkaOxbrvRnZyrZaOrwm63xKWjomWXnrGltdKhZKmqlZy7orrTZmhvbmZphnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./central-coast-massacre-mother-of-murdered-daughters-tells-full-story-for-first-time-25-years-on.html><span>←</span><span>Central Coast massacre: Ann Gannan says, the girls had no chance</span></a>
