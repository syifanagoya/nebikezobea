Over the course of his career, Fowler has notched up a number of impressive wins, but as it happens, many of the celebrity’s fans are more interested in his personal life – specifically, where he chose to go on his infamous honeymoon in late 2019.</p><p><strong>The destination of Rickie Fowler’s honeymoon is unknown. One credible media outlet suggested that the couple’s idyllic getaway took place in </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>South Africa</strong></a><strong>, while TMZ went with a more </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>ambiguous line</strong></a><strong>: “the two hopped on Puma’s private jet and took a sick vacay to some remote beaches”.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Despite the exact location of the couple’s honeymoon remaining undisclosed to the public, one aspect of the trip did make the news when it was revealed that during the honeymoon, Fowler picked up a common bacterial infection known as <a href=# rel=noopener>Campylobacter jejuni</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Memorable Honeymoon</h2><p>One of the most common causes of food poisoning in both Europe and the United States, the infection that Fowler picked up during his trip is said to induce cramps, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Reflecting on the trip, Fowler <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “It was not a fun stretch”.</p><p>In fact, the only reason Fowler’s illness became public knowledge in the first place was that he was actually forced to <a href=# rel=noopener>withdraw</a> from the Mayakoba Golf Classic.&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on the incident, Fowler <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “I am taking medicine prescribed by my physician… But am not at full strength yet. As a result, I am ill-prepared to compete next week.”</p><p>During his recovery period, it was reported that Fowler was unable to get any practice in for just over <a href=# rel=noopener>two weeks</a>. Although following the advice given to him by his physician, this break from golf was the first in a long time, with Fowler even bringing his clubs to his wedding, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>: “I really never went that long without touching a club”.</p><p>After more than three months since he’d competed in a tournament, Fowler showed no signs of lasting damage after putting in a strong performance at the Hero World Challenge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Wedding</h2><p>Fowler and his wife, Allison Stokke, first announced their burgeoning romance in April 2017, when they shared a few pictures from a <a href=# rel=noopener>Moto GP race</a> they attended together in Texas. From that point onward, the couple was pretty inseparable.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Exploring Long Island one day a few years later, the couple decided that they were ready to take their relationship to the next level. Reflecting on the day Fowler got down on one knee, Stokke <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “At the end of the day, we were the only people on one of the beaches, and Rickie asked Justin to take a picture of us… After a couple of photos, I looked over and Rickie was down on one knee with a big smile on his face.”&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of planning the big day, it was originally reported that the couple wanted to get married in the Bahamas, but the fallout from Hurricane Doran changed their minds. Stokke <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “The impact on the islands, their residents, and our friends in the Abacos was heartbreaking… Our friends at Discovery Land Company also saw tremendous loss at Baker’s Bay and its surrounding areas, and they still managed to reach out and offer us a venue at one of their properties in Cabo [Mexico].&nbsp;</p><p>“We were very lucky, as we ended up with the most hospitable crew and perfect weather at El Dorado Golf & Beach Club and Chileno Bay Golf and Beach Club in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Elena Damy and her crew out of Cabo and our event planner, Marcy Blum of Marcy Blum Associates were miracle workers and helped us create an even more amazing setting with florals and decor, somehow all at the last minute.”</p><p>With Cabo, Mexico confirmed as the official destination, the couple went on to host a dreamy, secret beach ceremony where only close friends and family were invited. In fact, only a total of 48 people attended the wedding.</p><p>In terms of the big moment, Stokke <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “I’ve always looked forward to that moment walking down the aisle… It was pretty incredible to see him out there smiling and all of our close friends and family looking back.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Good and the Bad</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Despite the nasty bout of food poisoning that Fowler picked up during the couple’s subsequent furtive foray into paradise, it’s impossible not to gush at the golf star’s incredible beach ceremony. The festivities were said to go on until the early hours of the morning, with Stokke even <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>: “We ended up doing the cake the next morning… We were all too into the dancing!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGqsIyroJyjmZp6p7vWpZyrZZekerC6jKGgrGWYpLumxcyopqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-elvis-couldnt-stand.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Elvis Couldn't Stand</span></a>
