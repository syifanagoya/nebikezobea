Camilla Cabello is said to be dating Austin, the founder of Lox Club, a dating app that he created for Jews and non-Jews alike.</p><p>Pictures obtained by Page Six indicate how joyful and pleasant they are after talking, grinning, or roaming the streets of Los Angeles on Wednesday (15th June 2022) night. The pair are following each other on Instagram and appear to be cordial, based on the images taken that night.</p><p>Previously, Camilla Cabello was in a relationship with Shawn Mendes, and the two called it quits in November 2021 with an Instagram statement.
